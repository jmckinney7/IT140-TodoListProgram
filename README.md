# IT140-TodoListProgram
Python Program I created during my time in IT-140. The program is a console application that saves user-defined tasks in a .csv file. 

## TodoListProgram Summary
In IT-140, we were tasked with being creative and developing our own program. During this period, I decided to create a to-do list program that uses task data from the user to generate a .csv file to store their tasks in.

## Project flow
First, the program initially asks the user for x number of tasks for the iteration process to begin. Next, the application asks the user for a few properties (task name, due date, priority). Lastly, the data inserted by the user will then display on the terminal window, displaying the finalized output, also notifying the user that the file has been created.
